Here is a template for the site if you want to try and write the page yourself. I have tried to add in comments to help you fill in the details. Message me on twitter or email if you have any questions.

The content of the webpape is controlled by the index.html file. The changes you make to this will change the writing you see on the page.

All the design of the page (font, colours etc.) is controlled by the main.css file. You are welcome to customise this anyway you like.

You can open this html file using your browser. If you make a change to this or the main.css and save it, you can then see the change by refreshing your browser.

Here's where we will fill in all your work.
The h3 and h4 are your headers. These help split the links into categories.
The <a ... part is a link.

Replace the google link with the link to your Work
Replace "Work Title [Journal]" with whatever you like.

The <br> is a line brake. This makes sure each link is on a new line.
